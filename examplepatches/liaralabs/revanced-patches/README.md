## About

This is a small collection of patches to intended to allow the user to continue using Gamehub updates with a few key QoL improvements found in GameHub-Lite.

Patches currently include:
- Front-end Export (front-end emulation support)
  - Breaks apple/google login methods (won't fix)
- Enable debug mode (for app data access)
- Fix email logins (a new bug introduced in 5.3)

Has been tested against 5.3.3

## Get started

1. Get and install [ReVanced Manager](https://revanced.app/) on your device of choice
2. Enable "Use Alternative Sources" in ReVanced settings, as well as "Allow changing patch selection"
3. Change the "Alternative sources" repo organization from "revanced" to "liaralabs"
4. Restart the app, load in a fresh and untouched GameHub APK and away you go!

Please note, there are currently no guardrails on patch version compatibility. These patches are intended to be used against the latest available version of GameHub.

### Front-end Compatibility

You can launch games directly from a compatible front-end. For example, with Beacon:

```bash
am start -n com.xiaoji.egggame/com.xj.landscape.launcher.ui.gamedetail.GameDetailActivity -a com.gamehub.LAUNCH_GAME --es localGameId {file_content} --es steamAppId {file_content} --ez autoStartGame true
```

Note:
- The unaltered package name (`com.xiaoji.egggame`)
- The activity name (`com.gamehub.LAUNCH_GAME`)
