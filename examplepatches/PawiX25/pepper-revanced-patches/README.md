# Pepper ReVanced Patches

> 📦 **Also available for Morphe** → [pepper-morphe-patches](https://github.com/PawiX25/pepper-morphe-patches) — same patch set, ported to the [Morphe Patcher](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patcher) framework for use with [Morphe Manager](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-manager).

Unofficial [ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) patch bundle for the entire
**Pepper.com Group / TippingCanoe** family of regional deal-aggregator apps.

All fingerprint strings used by the patches in this bundle match identically
across every sister app, so the same patches apply to all ten of them.

## Cosmetic / quality-of-life patches

| # | Patch | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Enable debug menu** | Re-enables the hidden 3-dot debug menu in MainActivity (45 dev actions: ad inspector, exploration screens, navigation, consent reset, event theming, monetization, etc.). R8 strips the inflate call from the release build — this patch puts it back. |
| 2 | **Unlock tier-locked icons** | Makes all 12 membership-tier icons (Silver / Gold / Platinum + DealMinded / DealDetective / Chilling / Awesome / Tight / Cool / Mascots) available in the icon picker without farming loyalty points. Rewrites every `sget-object Lvsc;->{d,e,f}:Lvsc;` to the DEFAULT-tier `Lvsc;->c:Lvsc;`. |
| 3 | **Hide banner ads in feed** | Disables the Pubmatic OpenWrap / DFPBanner renderer in the deal feed. Ads never load and the empty gray ad-cell container is collapsed to zero (visibility=GONE + height=0 + all 4 margins=0). Lists look as if ad slots were never inserted. |
| 4 | **Always show event-theming icons** | Always shows all 4 event-theming icons (Black Friday, Summer Sales, Autumn Sales, El Buen Fin) in the picker, regardless of whether the corresponding event is currently active. Vanilla shows only the icon for the active event (if any) and hides the other 3. Depends on patch #2. |
| 5 | **Keep event icon after restart** | Disables the use-case that auto-restores the default icon on app start when an event has ended by date. Without this patch, picking SummerSales as your launcher reverts to default on next launch with the *"Our event mode is over!"* dialog. With it, your chosen event icon stays permanently. |
| 6 | **Fix spacing around hidden ad cells** | Companion to patch #3. Without this, after ad cells collapse to zero height, the deal-detail RecyclerView's `ItemDecoration` (`m07`) still allocates a section gap under each invisible ad AND paints a `shadow_divider` on top of the next section's header — producing a doubled gap and a visually clipped *"You may also like"* subheader. This patch inserts guards in `m07.a()` (`getItemOffsets`) and `m07.b()` (`onDraw`) so collapsed ad cells contribute no offset and no draw. Depends on patch #3. |
| 7 | **Compact deal cards** | **Opt-in.** Shrinks the redesigned 8.x deal cards and their loading skeletons toward the denser pre-redesign density. Targeted XML edits to `item_deal_thread_card.xml`, `item_deal_voucher_placeholder_card.xml` and `item_sponsored_thread_placeholder_card.xml`: thumbnail `108→92dp`, vote buttons `36→32dp`, temperature `Subtitle2→CaptionBold`, comment-count repositioned next to its button, Get-deal `MaterialButton` minHeight `48→40dp` with `insetTop/insetBottom=0` (kills the default 6dp Material insets that would otherwise clip the button text on a 40dp View). Skeleton dimensions match the real card 1:1 so loading-state placeholders snap to their final position. |

## Telemetry blocking patches

A second, **opt-in** family of patches that strip every piece of analytics
and ad-tracking the app emits.

* No TLS ClientHello to any known tracker host (Iterable, Pepper Ocular,
  Usercentrics 1px+UCT, Adjust, Vungle, Pubmatic, Moloco, Recombee,
  LiveRamp, Confiant, Crashlytics, Firebase Logging, Firebase Analytics,
  Firebase Remote Config, FB Audience Network, AppsFlyer, GMA / DoubleClick
  / 2mdn, graph.facebook.com).
* No outbound `analytics-event-report` POSTs (Pepper's own behavioural
  tracker for thread visits, shares, push clicks and search-suggestion
  clicks).
* All attempted tracker URLs are redirected to `127.0.0.1:1` and refused at
  the socket layer.
* No crashes, no Adjust threadpool activity, no GMA SDK init.
* `Pepper-Hardware-Id` is replaced with a per-install random ID in the
  same 32-char lowercase-hex format the stock app uses (UUID with the
  four dashes stripped — indistinguishable from `MD5(android_id).toHex()`
  by shape).
* Pepper API (`pepper.pl`), FCM token registration
  (`firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com`) and the system browser
  (Custom Tabs Login flow) keep working — these are load-bearing for the
  app and intentionally preserved.

| # | Patch | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | **Redirect tracker URLs to localhost** | dex string-pool rewrite. Every `const-string` and static-field initial value matching a known tracker host gets rewritten to `http://127.0.0.1:1`. Covers Iterable, Pepper Ocular, Usercentrics, Adjust, Vungle, Pubmatic, Firebase Analytics / Remote Config / Crashlytics-settings, LiveRamp, Confiant, Moloco, FB Audience, FB Login (`graph.%s`), GMA, IMA, fundingchoicesmessages, mediation.goog. SDKs that survive end up calling `connect()` on port 1 → `ECONNREFUSED`. Foundation patch — every other telemetry patch depends on this one. |
| T2 | **Neuter tracker auto-init ContentProviders** | Replaces `onCreate()Z` body of `com.vungle.ads.VungleProvider`, `com.adjust.sdk.SystemLifecycleContentProvider`, and `com.facebook.ads.AudienceNetworkContentProvider` with `return false`. Android marks each provider as failed-init and never invokes any of its query/insert/update/delete methods, killing the SDK auto-init code that ran inside `onCreate`. Bytecode equivalent of removing `<provider>` from AndroidManifest.xml. |
| T3 | **Kill Pepper first-party pixel tracking** | Two NOPs against Pepper's own first-party tracking: (a) `AnalyticsEventTransmissionWorker.a(Continuation)` (Pepper Ocular pixel-firing CoroutineWorker) → `return Result.Success()`, so pushed pixel URLs are stored in Room DB but never POSTed; (b) `Lw05;->intercept` (Pepper-Hardware-Id OkHttp interceptor) → real hardware ID is replaced with a per-install random ID in the stock 32-char lowercase-hex format, persisted to `SharedPreferences("revanced_pepper", "mock_hwid")`. The same value feeds both `POST /device` registration and the request header so Daily Picks (`/dealbot/enable`) keeps working. Standalone — no dependencies. |
| T4 | **Kill Datatransport upload pipeline** | NOPs `JobInfoSchedulerService.onStartJob/onStopJob` and `AlarmManagerSchedulerBroadcastReceiver.onReceive` from the Google Datatransport runtime, killing the JobScheduler + AlarmManager paths that drive Crashlytics report uploads (`crashlyticsreports-pa.googleapis.com`) and Firebase logging uploads (`firebaselogging-pa.googleapis.com`). These two hostnames live as Base64-encoded `byte[]` inside `CctTransportBackend` and never appear as `const-string` in the dex — patch T1 cannot reach them. T4 cuts off the upload entry points instead. |
| T5 | **Disable Google Mobile Ads SDK init** | Replaces both overloads of `com.google.android.gms.ads.MobileAds.initialize(...)` with `return-void`. `MobileAdsInitProvider` is already a no-op placeholder, but Pepper itself manually calls `MobileAds.initialize(context)` from `nh4.smali` during ad-render path setup. Without this patch the GMA SDK still spins up and pre-fetches script/HTML/appcache resources from `googleads.g.doubleclick.net` plus `gampad/ads` ad requests to `pubads.g.doubleclick.net`. |
| T6 | **Disable GMA ad-load entry points** | Sits on top of T5. Replaces every public `load*` method on `AdLoader`, `AdManagerAdView`, `AdManagerInterstitialAd`, `RewardedAd`, and `RewardedInterstitialAd` with `return-void`. Pepper's native-ad path calls `AdLoader$Builder.forCustomFormatAd(...).build().loadAd(AdManagerAdRequest)` independent of `MobileAds.initialize`; Pubmatic's DFP bridge calls `AdManagerAdView.loadAd` directly. Both share these GMS load methods as the runtime URL emitter. With them NOPped, all GMA-related TLS ClientHello disappear. |
| T7 | **Disable Adjust SDK** | Replaces every state-mutating public static method on `com.adjust.sdk.Adjust` (`initSdk`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `trackEvent`, `trackAdRevenue`, `verifyAndTrackPlayStorePurchase`, `enable`, `disable`, `addGlobalCallbackParameter`, `addGlobalPartnerParameter`) with `return-void`. T2 cuts the ContentProvider auto-init route; T7 cuts the manual route from `PepperApplication.onCreate → Adjust.initSdk(...)`. URLs are still redirected by T1 as a safety net. `getDefaultInstance()` is intentionally left intact so caller code doesn't NPE. |
| T8 | **Disable PAIRIP license check** *(`com.pepperdeals` only)* | Removes Google Play's PAIRIP anti-tampering kit that ships **only** in the US `com.pepperdeals` build. PAIRIP requires `getInstallerPackageName == com.android.vending`; sideloaded APKs fail the check and PAIRIP shows a non-dismissable dialog blocking the app. Replaces `LicenseContentProvider.onCreate()Z` with `return false` and `LicenseClient.initializeLicenseCheck()V` with `return-void`. `compatibleWith` restricted to `com.pepperdeals` so T8 doesn't surface in Manager for the nine regional builds that don't bundle PAIRIP. Standalone. |
| T9 | **Skip Usercentrics consent screen** | Rewrites the choke-point `(state) → AppStartProcessRequiredSteps` converter that the AppStartProcess navigator funnels every nav decision through, so it always returns `(showCmp = false, showNotifPrompt = true)`. The CMP screen and its synchronous SDK fetch wait are skipped on cold start; the user lands directly on the notification-permission prompt and then the feed. The Usercentrics SDK still initialises (otherwise FB Login crashes — the two SDKs share `Validate.sdkInitialized()`); only the rendering and wait are short-circuited. |
| T10 | **Block Pepper analytics-event-report tracker** | Rewrites every Retrofit `@POST` annotation whose path starts with `analytics-event-report` to the absolute URL `http://127.0.0.1:1/revanced-blocked-pepper-ocular`. When a Retrofit `@POST` value starts with `http://` it replaces the configured base URL — so the request never reaches `www.pepper.pl`. OkHttp connects to localhost, the kernel refuses, the request never leaves the device, and Pepper's fire-and-forget caller swallows the IOException. Covers `event=thread_visit`, `event=thread_share`, `event=mobile_push_notification_click`, `event=mobile_app_search_suggestion_click`, and the generic dispatcher used for ad-hoc events. |

### Dependency graph

```
T1 (Redirect URLs) ──── root, no deps
T3 (KillFirstPartyPixel)  root, no deps  (Pepper-only, doesn't touch any third-party SDK)
T8 (NeuterPairipLicense)  root, no deps  (com.pepperdeals only — Play Store DRM, not telemetry)
T9 (SkipCmpScreen)        root, no deps  (UI-layer bypass)

T2 (NeuterProviders)      ──→ T1
T4 (KillDatatransport)    ──→ T1, T2
T5 (NopGmaInit)           ──→ T1, T2
T7 (NopAdjustSdk)         ──→ T1, T2
T10 (KillPepperAnalyticsReport)  ──→ T1

T6 (NopGmaAdLoader)       ──→ T1, T2, T5      (the deepest)
```

These are encoded as `dependsOn(...)` in each patch file. When you enable a
leaf patch in ReVanced Manager, the bundle auto-pulls its transitive
dependencies — enabling **only** T6 in `revanced-cli` auto-applies T1, T2
and T5 in addition.

### Verification commands

After installing the patched APK, you can prove each patch is live without
running any analytics flow:

```bash
# T1 — count localhost-redirected connection attempts during a session
adb shell su 0 sh -c "iptables -I OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner $(adb shell pm list packages -U com.tippingcanoe.pepperpl | cut -d: -f3 | tr -d '\r') -j NFLOG --nflog-group 30"
adb shell su 0 sh -c 'tcpdump -i nflog:30 -w /sdcard/pepper.pcap -U -s 0 &'
# … use the app for a while …
adb pull /sdcard/pepper.pcap   # any TCP destination 127.0.0.1:1 is a T1 hit

# T2 — bytecode evidence: onCreate body returns false
apktool d -f patched.apk -o /tmp/p
grep -A4 'onCreate()Z' /tmp/p/smali_classes*/com/vungle/ads/VungleProvider.smali
# Expected:
#   .method public onCreate()Z
#       .locals 1
#       const/4 p0, 0x0
#       return p0

# T3 — runtime evidence: per-install ID was generated and persisted
adb shell su 0 cat /data/data/com.tippingcanoe.pepperpl/shared_prefs/revanced_pepper.xml
# Expected:  <string name="mock_hwid">…32 hex chars, no dashes…</string>

# T7 — runtime evidence: no Adjust threadpool activity
adb logcat -d | grep 'Adjust-pool'   # expected: no output
```

## Install

### Option A — ReVanced Manager (recommended)

Tested with [inotia00/revanced-manager](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-manager/releases) v2.5.x (`app.revanced.manager.flutter` package). The official ReVanced/revanced-manager should also work — they both use patcher v22.

1. Install ReVanced Manager on your Android device.
2. In Manager: **Settings → Sources → Patches**, paste:
   ```
   https://github.com/PawiX25/pepper-revanced-patches/releases/latest/download/manifest.json
   ```
   *(Don't use `api.github.com/.../releases/latest` — Manager parses its
   `created_at` field with timezone-naive `LocalDateTime`, which fails on the `Z`
   suffix GitHub returns. The repo's CI publishes a hand-crafted manifest in the
   format Manager actually accepts.)*
3. Pick any of the 10 listed APKs from your device storage. Manager doesn't
   auto-fetch them — extract from your installed app or download from APKPure.
4. Select the patches you want → **Patch** → **Install**.

### Option B — revanced-cli (desktop)

```bash
# 1. Download a release .rvp from this repo's releases page
# 2. Download revanced-cli: https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli/releases
# 3. Patch:
java -jar revanced-cli.jar patch \
    --patches pepper-patches.rvp \
    --out pepper-patched.apk \
    pepper-original.apk

# 4. Sign + align (apksigner from Android SDK build-tools):
apksigner sign --ks ~/.android/debug.keystore --ks-pass pass:android \
    --ks-key-alias androiddebugkey --key-pass pass:android \
    --out pepper-signed.apk pepper-patched.apk
```

These apps ship as XAPKs with split APKs for ABI / DPI / language. The patch
bundle only modifies the **base** APK — install the patched base alongside the
original `arm64_v8a` and `xxxhdpi` (or your own DPI) splits via
`adb install-multiple`.

---

## Build from source

Requires **JDK 17** and **Android SDK build-tools** (for `d8`, exposed via
`ANDROID_HOME`). The patches are compiled against ReVanced Patcher v22, which
isn't published on any public Maven; clone and install it to mavenLocal first:

```bash
# 1. Build patcher v22 to mavenLocal (one-time)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patcher.git /tmp/rv-patcher
cd /tmp/rv-patcher
sed -i 's/^version = .*/version = 22.0.1-SNAPSHOT/' gradle.properties
sed -i '/signAllPublications()/d; /useGpgCmd()/d' patcher/build.gradle.kts
./gradlew :patcher:publishJvmPublicationToMavenLocal \
    -PgithubPackagesUsername=$(gh api user --jq .login) \
    -PgithubPackagesPassword=$(gh auth token)

# 2. Build the bundle
cd path/to/pepper-revanced-patches
./gradlew buildPatchBundle
# Output: build/libs/pepper-patches-<version>.rvp
```

The CI workflow does the same thing on every tag push.

Each patch file documents the obfuscated symbol it targets, the heuristic used
to find it under R8 minification, and the smali stub it injects. Read them
before reporting bugs against newer versions — the heuristics are documented
so they can be adjusted without re-reverse-engineering.
