/**
 * Bytecode equivalent of removing tracker `<provider>` entries from
 * AndroidManifest.xml — but achieved by neutering each provider's `onCreate`
 * method instead of touching the manifest.
 *
 * Why bytecode and not manifest:
 *   ReVanced 22.0.1-SNAPSHOT's `resourcePatch` machinery runs the bundled
 *   AAPT2 against Pepper's resources and produces a re-encoded
 *   `resources.arsc` + binary `AndroidManifest.xml.bin` that Pepper PL
 *   8.13.00 fails to boot (white-screened on AppStartProcessActivity, no
 *   logcat error, splash never advances). A diagnostic no-op `resourcePatch`
 *   that opens the manifest and writes nothing reproduces the hang exactly,
 *   so the fault is in the resource-recompile pipeline, not in any specific
 *   manifest edit. Pure `bytecodePatch` work is unaffected.
 *
 * What this patch does:
 *   For each tracker `ContentProvider`, replace its `onCreate()Z` body with:
 *       .method public onCreate()Z
 *           .locals 0
 *           const/4 p0, 0x0
 *           return p0
 *       .end method
 *   When `onCreate` returns false, Android marks the provider as failed-init
 *   in `ContentProviderHolder`, removes it from the package's published
 *   provider table, and never invokes any of its query/insert/update/delete
 *   methods. The SDK's auto-init code that lived inside `onCreate` (e.g.
 *   `VungleProvider.onCreate` calls `k6.Companion` SDK
 *   init; `SystemLifecycleContentProvider.onCreate` instantiates the Adjust
 *   SystemLifecycle singleton) never runs.
 *
 *   This is the SAME effective behaviour as removing `<provider>` from the
 *   manifest (which patchinfo.txt §1 documented, but which we cannot apply
 *   via resourcePatch — see above). The difference is purely the layer at
 *   which we cut the SDK off: manifest = "this provider does not exist",
 *   bytecode = "this provider exists but immediately reports failure".
 *
 * Providers neutered:
 *   - com.vungle.ads.VungleProvider                     (Vungle ad SDK auto-
 *                                                        init — also kills
 *                                                        Liftoff backend
 *                                                        calls to
 *                                                        us-event.app-install.bid
 *                                                        and cdn/impression-
 *                                                        east.liftoff.io,
 *                                                        because Liftoff is
 *                                                        Vungle's parent and
 *                                                        the SDK relays via
 *                                                        it on init)
 *   - com.adjust.sdk.SystemLifecycleContentProvider     (Adjust attribution
 *                                                        SDK singleton init)
 *   - com.facebook.ads.AudienceNetworkContentProvider   (FB Audience Network)
 *
 * Why FacebookInitProvider is NOT in this list:
 *   `LoginManager.logIn()` calls `Validate.sdkInitialized()` and crashes
 *   with `FacebookSdkNotInitializedException` if the SDK was never set up.
 *   The graph.facebook.com telemetry is cut at the URL layer instead by
 *   [redirectTrackerUrlsPatch], so the SDK initialises, the requests hit
 *   127.0.0.1:1 and refuse, and Login still works.
 *
 *   MobileAdsInitProvider is NOT in this list because in 8.13.00 its
 *   onCreate already returns false and does no work (verified in stock
 *   smali; it's a placeholder for future GMA versions). Pepper's GMA
 *   initialisation runs from its own code path (nh4.smali manually calls
 *   MobileAds.initialize()), which the URL-redirect patch handles.
 *
 *   IterableFirebaseMessagingService is a `<service>`, not a `<provider>` —
 *   different mechanism, would need a different bytecode neuter strategy
 *   (e.g. neuter `IterableFirebaseMessagingService.onMessageReceived`).
 *   Left as future work; the URL-redirect already prevents Iterable from
 *   reaching api.iterable.com at all.
