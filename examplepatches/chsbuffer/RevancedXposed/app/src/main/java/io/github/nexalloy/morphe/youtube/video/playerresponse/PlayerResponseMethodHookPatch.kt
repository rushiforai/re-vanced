/**
 * Hooks the video id of every video when loaded.
 * Supports all videos and functions in all situations.
 *
 * First parameter is the video id.
 * Second parameter is if the video is a Short AND it is being opened or is currently playing.
 *
 * Hook is always called off the main thread.
 *
 * This hook is called as soon as the player response is parsed,
 * and called before many other hooks are updated such as [playerTypeHookPatch].
 *
 * Note: The video id returned here may not be the current video that's being played.
 * It's common for multiple Shorts to load at once in preparation
 * for the user swiping to the next Short.
 *
 * For most use cases, you probably want to use [io.github.nexalloy.morphe.youtube.video.videoid.videoIdHooks] instead.
 *
 * Be aware, this can be called multiple times for the same video id.
