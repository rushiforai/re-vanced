# v1.8.0-dev.12 (2026-02-14)


# Features

- Added a confirmation dialog for favoriting files with the custom file picker
- Added an image preview dialog that opens when you tap the small image icon on the left for image files in the custom file picker https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/issues/176
- Made user-selected image backgrounds persistent by importing the selected image into the app’s internal storage, so the original file doesn’t need to remain on the device. Users who set a custom image background before dev.12 will need to reset and reselect their background for this change to take effect.
- Replaced `Image selected: <filename>` with a preview of the selected background image
- Added downloader support to the `Merge split APKs` tool
- Added signing to the `Merge split APKs` tool so the output APK is not unsigned
- Made the `Merge split APKs` tool always run in another process (due to the intensity of merging some split APKs). If a separate process can’t be used, it will fall back to running in-app
