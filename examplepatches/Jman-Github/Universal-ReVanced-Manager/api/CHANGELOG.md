# v1.7.1 (2026-01-22)


# ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

The `Discover patch bundles` screen has been updated to use [Brosssh's new API](https://github.com/brosssh/revanced-external-bundles/blob/dev/docs/graphql-examples.md). As a result, you will need to reimport any patch bundles that were added via the Discovery system prior to this release to continue receiving updates from their remote sources.

Additionally, due to a keystore system update, you may need to export and then re-import the Manager’s keystore to resolve a signing error during patching. This is a one-time step after installing version 1.7.1 for the first time.

- Fixed metadata issues with saved patched apps that would sometimes occur
- Fixed issues with InstallerX Revived's silent installer and the manager not detecting an install and timing out instead (if the install made by InstallerX Revived fails, the manager cannot detect the failure. Either wait for the installer to timeout, or exit the patcher screen by pressing "Leave anyway" on the dialog) https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/issues/43
- Fixed the select from storage page not graying out non .apk, .apks, .apkm, or .xapk
- Changed the supported downloader plugins URLs to Brosssh's fork (which has released builds for all plugins)
- Fixed installer selection resetting to the system installer when a third-party installer (such as InstallerX Revived) is set as the device's default APK handler https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/issues/26
- Fixed manually added custom installers not being removed from the installer selection menus sometimes after the user removes them from their saved custom installers
- Fixed patch bundle imports/updates sometimes crashing or hanging (empty bundles, PR artifacts missing `.rvp`, and stuck "0/1" updates) https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/issues/55
- Mitigated false "Installation failed" reports when Play Protect scanning delays installs (if a timeout dialog still appears, but it installs successfully, the successful install will supersede the false dialog) https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/issues/48
- Fixed Pure Black theme preset toggle from getting stuck in a disabled state

- Vietnamese localization (new app language option) https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/pull/38
- Revamped Settings > General theme presets: the System preset is now labeled "Follow system" (and is the default for new installs/resets), the Pure black option is simplified to "Pure black", every preset remains single-select so you can clear them to return to manual colors, Dynamic color is the only preset that blocks accent tweaks, and the preset description copy better explains how these toggles work https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/issues/29
- Renamed the dynamic theme to "Material You"

- New Advanced setting lets you choose whether the patch selection action panel should auto-collapse after toggling patches
- Added an option in settings under Settings > Advanced "Patch selection action buttons order" that lets you reorder the patch selection action buttons

- Updated to Liso’s patcher v22 (backwards compatible with existing patch bundles too) https://github.com/Jman-Github/Universal-ReVanced-Manager/pull/39
- Moved the rearrange patch bundles button in the patch bundles tab to the top right, next to the settings gear
- Removed the old "patch does not exist" error handling system and replaced it with a simple warning dialog that tells the user the issue, before the patching process begins
